# js_api_project
my first javascript project using an api

in this project I'm using zenquotes.io api to create a page that shows a random quote or a list of quotes
quotes can be filtered e.g. by author, length or kerywords, so the user could choose a matching quote for a given topic or find quotes from their favorite author...
nothing fancy just for practising...
